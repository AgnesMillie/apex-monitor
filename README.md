## üìñ About The Project

Apex Monitor is a service designed to provide developers and businesses with a clear and dependable overview of their API's health. In a world where API reliability is crucial, Apex Monitor acts as a vigilant guardian, constantly checking your endpoints and alerting you the moment something goes wrong.

This project serves as a signature piece in my portfolio, demonstrating skills in full-stack development, software architecture, and DevOps practices.

### Built With

This project is built with modern technologies to ensure scalability and performance:

* **Backend:** [Node.js | Java | Python]
* **Frontend:** [React.js | TypeScript]
* **Database:** [MySQL]
* **Infrastructure:** [Docker]

---

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system is designed using a microservices-oriented architecture to ensure separation of concerns and scalability.

* **`api-server`**: The core REST API that handles user authentication, endpoint management (CRUD), and data retrieval for the dashboard.
* **`frontend`**: A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React that provides the user interface.
* **`checker-worker`**: A separate, continuously running service that polls the registered API endpoints at regular intervals and records the health status.
* **`Database`**: A MySQL instance for data persistence.

*(A diagram will be added here later)*

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**

    git clone [https://github.com/SEU_USUARIO/apex-monitor.git](https://github.com/SEU_USUARIO/apex-monitor.git)
    cd apex-monitor
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it based on the `.env.example` file (which we will create later).

3.  **Build and run with Docker**
