## üìñ About The Project

Apex Monitor is a backend-focused portfolio project designed to demonstrate a scalable and maintainable software architecture. It simulates a real-world monitoring service where different parts of the application (API, background workers) are decoupled and containerized.

This project showcases key skills in:
* **Microservices Architecture:** Decoupling the main user-facing API from the background checking service to ensure separation of concerns and scalability.
* **Backend Development:** Building a secure REST API with user authentication (JWT) and full CRUD functionalities using Node.js and TypeScript.
* **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Orchestrating a multi-container environment using Docker and Docker Compose, including health checks for robust service dependency management.
* **Database Management:** Designing a relational database schema with foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

### Built With
* **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* **Infrastructure:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, orchestrated entirely by Docker Compose.

* **`api-server`**: The core REST API. It handles user registration, login (JWT generation), and CRUD operations for the endpoints to be monitored.
* **`checker-worker`**: A separate background service. It periodically fetches all endpoints from the database and performs HTTP requests to check their status.
* **`db`**: A MySQL database instance that persists all user and endpoint data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy of the backend services up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
* Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/AgnesMillie/apex-monitor.git](https://github.com/AgnesMillie/apex-monitor.git)
    cd apex-monitor
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:
        ```sh
        # For Windows (Command Prompt)
        copy .env.example .env

        # For Windows (PowerShell)
        cp .env.example .env

        # For Linux/macOS
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Fill in the required variables in your new `.env` file.

3.  **Build and run with Docker**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

| -------------------- | ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/auth/register` | `POST` | No | Registers a new user. |
| `/api/auth/login` | `POST` | No | Authenticates a user and returns a JWT. |
| | | | |
| `/api/endpoints` | `GET` | **Yes** | Lists all endpoints for the authenticated user. |
| `/api/endpoints` | `POST` | **Yes** | Adds a new endpoint to monitor. |
| `/api/endpoints/:id` | `PUT` | **Yes** | Updates an existing endpoint. |
